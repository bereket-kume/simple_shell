# Simple Shell Project

This project is a basic implementation of a command-line shell, similar to the Unix/Linux terminal. It allows users to enter commands, execute them, and interact with the system in a minimal way. The shell supports running standard system commands, changing directories, and basic input handling. It serves as a foundational exercise to understand how command interpreters work under the hood and how operating systems manage processes and user inputs.
